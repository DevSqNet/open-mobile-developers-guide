## public narrative: story of self

**OBJECTIVES:** By the end of this training, you  will…

- Learn the basics of how public narrative works: values, emotion & story structure
- Learn criteria for an effective story of self and coach others on improving their storytelling
- Practice and get feedback on your own story of self

### EACH OF US HAS A COMPELLING STORY TO TELL    

Each of us has a story that can move others to action. As you learn this skill, you will be learning to tell a story about yourself, the community you organize with, and your strategy that motivates others to join you in creating change. In addition, you will gain practice in listening, and coaching others to tell a good story.

### PUBLIC NARRATIVE IS A PRACTICE OF LEADERSHIP

Leadership is about accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty. Narrative is how we learn to make choices and construct our identities and purpose—as individuals, as communities and organizations, and as nations. 

What does public narrative have to do with this definition of leadership? You can’t ask others to follow you if they don’t understand what your intentions are, and why you are called to lead 

### THE HEAD & THE HEART

There are two ways we understand the world: through our head (strategy &analysis) and through our heart (story & motivation). To enable others to achieve shared purpose, public leaders must employ BOTH the head and the heart of their constituency in order to mobilize others to act on behalf of shared values. In other words, they engage people in interpreting _why_ they should change their world (their motivation) and _how_they can act to change it (their strategy). Public narrative is the “why”—the art of translating values into action through stories.

### VALUES INSPIRE ACTION THROUGH EMOTION

We don’t think our values; we feel our values. Often we don’t realize what we value in the world until we hear a story or witness an injustice that stirs emotions within us. Emotions inform us of what we value in ourselves, in others, and in the world, and they enable us to express the motivational content of our values to others. Because stories allow us to express our values not as abstract principles, but as lived experience, they have the power to move others to action.

#### Exploring our values:

Each photo below reveals a human story connected to an injustice. Review the photos below to further explore your own values and the process in which you come to realize what you value. Pay attention to your feelings--what specific emotions do you feel? Did you realize you value something that you may not have articulated before? Do you feel inspired to take action?

 | | **What feelings or emotions does this photo evoke?** | **What value does this reveal that you hold?** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **HURRICANE KATRINA** | | |
| **ICE RAIDS** | | |
| **OIL SPILL** | | |
| **THE ECONOMY** | | |

### SOME EMOTIONS INHIBIT ACTION, OTHERS MOTIVATE ACTION 

Public leaders often encounter individuals or groups where mindful action is inhibited by inertia, fear, self-doubt, isolation, and apathy. The job of a leader is not to tell people to stop feeling this way but rather use storytelling to move people from feelings of stagnation to feelings of motivation - urgency, hope, YCMAD (you can make a difference), solidarity, and anger. The language of emotion is the language of movement—they actually share the same root word. Stories mobilize emotions of action to overcome emotions that inhibit us from mindful action.

### PUBLIC NARRATIVE COMBINES A STORY OF SELF, US AND NOW

#### STORY OF SELF 

By telling a “story of self” you can communicate the values that move you to lead. Public leaders face the challenge of enabling others to “get” the values that move them to lead. Effective communication of motivating values can establish grounds for trust, empathy, and understanding. In its absence, people will infer our motivations, often in ways that can be very counterproductive. Telling our story of self can help establish firm ground for leadership, collaboration and discovering common purpose.

Every one of us has a compelling story of self to tell. We all have people in our lives (parents, grandparents, teachers, friends, colleagues) or characters we love, whosestories influence our own values. And we all have made choices in response to our own challenges that shape our life’s path— confrontations with pain, moments of hope, calls to action.

The key focus is on our choices, those moments in our lives when our values moved us to act in the face of challenge. When did you first care about being heard? When did you feel you had to act? Why did you feel you could act? What were the circumstances, the place, the colors, sounds? What did it look like? The power in your story of self is to reveal something of those moments that were deeply meaningful to you in shaping your life—not your deepest private secrets, but the events that shaped your public life. Learning to tell a good story of self demands the_courage of introspection_, and of sharing some of what you find. 

#### STORY OF US

By telling a “story of us” you can communicate values that can inspire others to act together by identifying with each other, not only with you. 

Just as with a story of self, key choice points in the life of a community—its founding, crises it has faced, or other events that everyone remembers—are moments that express the values shared. Consider stories that members of your group have shared, especially those that held similar meaning for all of you. The key is to focus on telling a specific story about specific people at a specific time that can remind everyone – or call to everyone’s attention – values that you share. Telling a good story of us requires the_courage of empathy_ – to consider the experience of others deeply enough to take a chance at articulating that experience. 

#### STORY OF NOW

By telling a “story of now” you can communicate an urgent challenge we are called upon to face, the hope that we can face it and the hopeful outcome we can create together, and the choice we must make to act now. 

A story of now requires telling stories that bring the urgency of the challenge alive: urgency because of a need for change that cannot be denied, urgency because of a moment of opportunity that may not return.  A story of now also offers hope—not make believe hope, but real, plausible hope, often grounded in what others are already achieving, grounded in the courage of others’ actions, and in the strategic vision of what we can achieve together.  At the intersection of the urgency and the promise of hope is a choice that must be made – to act, or not to act, to act in this way, or in that. Telling a good story of now requires the_courage of imagination_, or as Walter Brueggemann named it, a prophetic imagination, in which you call attention both to the pain of the world and also to the possibility for a better future.


### STORY STRUCTURE: CHALLENGE, CHOICE, OUTCOME

Every human story has a plot. A plot begins with a challenge that confronts a character with an urgent need to pay attention, to make a choice for which s/he is unprepared. The choice yields an outcome, and the outcome teaches a moral. 

A good story allows the listener to empathetically identify with the character and“feel” the moral. We hear “about” someone’s courage; we are also inspired by it.

The story of the character and his or her choices encourages listeners to think about their own values and challenges, and inspires them with new ways of thinking about how to make choices in their own lives.

#### Incorporating Challenge, Choice, and Outcome in Your Own Story

There are some key questions you need to answer as you consider the choices you have made in your life and the path you have taken that brought you to this point in time as a leader. Once you identify the specific _relevant_ choice, dig deeper by answering the following questions.

**Challenge**: Why did you feel it was a challenge? What was so challenging about it? Why was it your challenge?

**Choice**: Why did you make the choice you did? Where did you get the courage (or not)? Where did you get the hope (or not)? Did your parents or grandparents’ life stories teach you in any way how to act in that moment? How did it feel?

**Outcome**: How did the outcome feel? Why did it feel that way? What did it teach you? What do you want to teach us? How do you want us to feel?

**A word about challenge**. Sometimes people see the word challenge and think it means describing the worst misfortunes of our lives. Sometimes those are the moments that most shaped us. But keep in mind that a struggle might also be one of your own choosing – a high mountain you decided to climb as much as a valley you managed to climb out of. Many things may have been a challenge to you and can be the source of a good story to inspire others.

## SAMPLE STORY OF SELF: Lilian Molina

>As told at Powershift 2011: a gathering of 10,000 climate activists from around the US.

_Greetings, My name is_ Lilian Maria Molina and I am the Environmental Justice Director at Energy Action Coalition.  I am part Mayas-Chorti, Lenca and Palestinian, was born in Honduras, Central America and moved to the United States at the age of 5 with my mother.  For the first couple years my mom and I would take an hour-long ride on a two-floor train; I would always rush to the top floor, look out the window, and envision what I would do at our destination. I would imagine the cartoons I would watch, salivate over the Kudos and Pringles I would be able to eat, and think about all the great toys I would play with. Then one day, as I was playing with a fully equipped Barbie Mansion, my mom reached over and handed me a bottle of Windex and paper towels; at that moment I realized that our hour-long train ride wasn’t a field trip, it was a commute to work. My mom and I were there to clean houses not to play.  

From that moment on I started to notice that things looked very different in different parts of town. I wondered why some families lived in three floor homes, while I lived in a one-bedroom basement apartment with two families. I wondered why the park equipment in my neighborhood was always broken, but was fancy and new on the other side of town. I wondered if people in the neighborhood where my mom and I cleaned houses had to worry about La Migra coming to their jobs or their homes. I wondered if the kids at these houses ever had to miss school to translate for their parents.  I wondered why the police didn’t arrest kids around these houses for standing on the corner but my friends back in the neighborhood were arrested all the time. I slowly started to understand that these were two separate worlds.  

As I got older, I would refuse to take the hour-long train ride with my mom, instead I would hang out with my friends in the neighborhood. When I was 12, my mom noticed that I was starting to get involved in some risky activities. She decided to send me to Honduras for the summer to spend time with Mi Abuelita (grandma). That summer Mi Abuelita, a Natural Healer and Master Gardener, helped me connect to my ancestral roots and taught me how to love nature through gardening. I learned about all the different plants that she used to help heal people and deliver babies - it was an eye-opening experience. That summer I also realized that some of the people that looked like my family and I wore suits to work and lived in houses rather than apartments.

When I came back to the U.S, I returned to hanging out with my friends; but when I was 16, I decided I was done watching my friends get beat up, get beat by the cops, or arrested. My friends and I started hosting different activities to keep our friends from joining street gangs.  Throughout high school we organized different events, from parties, to walkouts to bring awareness to the violence in our communities. Around this time I remembered how the garden that Mi Abuelita introduced me to helped me to heal, and started wondering if a garden in our community could have the same impact for other young people. I got super excited and started looking for plots of land around the school. But in my search I learned that most of the land in Little Village was contaminated with industrial pollution. I thought to myself, “You have to be kidding me, on top of all of the issues I was aware of, our land is also polluted? We have poor education, gang violence, police brutality, immigration raids, militarization of schools and we also have contamination in our community? What the heck else could be wrong?” I learned that what my community was experiencing is called Environmental Racism and what we need is Environmental Justice before we can plant gardens here in Little Village…and that is what brought me to the work that I am doing now.

Now I am here at Power Shift with Front-line Community Members and our Allies, working with the leadership of front-line communities and helping them create a trans-local movement to oppose corporate power is where there is strategic need for youth leadership.

## WORKSHEET
DEVELOPING YOUR STORY OF SELF

**Before you decide what part of your story to tell, think about these questions:**

1. What will I be calling on others to do?
1. What values move me to take action and might also inspire others to similar action?
1. What stories can I tell from my own life about specific people or events that would _show_ (rather than tell) how I learned or acted on those values?

**What are the experiences in your life that have shaped the values that call you to leadership in this campaign?**

| **FAMILY & CHILDHOOD** | **LIFE CHOICES** | **ORGANIZING EXPERIENCES** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Parents/Family | School | First Experience of organizing | 
| Growing Up | Career | Connection to key books or people | 
| Your Community | Partner/Family | Role Models |
| Role Models | Hobbies/Interests/Talents |
| School | Finding Passion | 
| | Overcoming Challenge | 


Think about the challenge, choice and outcome in your story. The outcome might be what you learned, in addition to what happened.

_Try drawing pictures here instead of words_. Powerful stories leave your listeners with images in their minds that shape their understanding of you and your calling_._

| **CHALLENGE** | **CHOICE** | **OUTCOME** |

## COACHING TIPS:
STORY OF SELF

Remember to balance both positive and constructive critical feedback. The purpose of coaching is to listen to the _way_ stories are told and think of ways that the storytelling could be improved.

**DON’T** simply offer vague “feel good” comments. (“That was a really great story!”)

**DO** coach each other on the following points:

1. **_THE CHALLENGE:_**What were the specific challenges the storyteller faced? Did the storyteller paint a vivid picture of those challenges?
  - _“When you described ________, I got a clear picture of the challenge.”_
  - _“I understood the challenge to be ________. Is that what you intended?”_

1. **_THE CHOICE:_**Was there a clear choice that was made in response to each challenge? How did the choice make you feel? (Hopeful? Angry?)

  - _“To me, the choice you made was _______, and it made me feel _______.”_
  - _“It would be helpful if you focused on the moment you made a choice.”_

1. **_THE OUTCOME:_**What was the specific outcome that resulted from each choice? What does that outcome teach us?
  - _“I understood the outcome was _______, and it teaches me _______. But how does it relate to your work now?”_

1. **_THE VALUES:_**Could you identify what this person’s values are and where they came from? How? How did the story make you feel?
  - _“Your story made me feel ________ because _________.”_

  - _“It’s clear from your story that you value _______; but it could be even clearer if you told a story about where that value comes from.”_

1. **_DETAILS:_** Were there sections of the story that had especially good details or images (e.g. sights, sounds, smells, or emotions of the moment)? 
  - _“The image of ________ really helped me identify with what you were feeling.”_
  - _“Try telling more details about _______ so we can imagine what you were experiencing.”_
