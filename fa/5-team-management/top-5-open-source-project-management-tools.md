منبع : [OpenSource.com] (http://opensource.com/business/15/1/top-project-management-tools-2015). Also, [reference 2014's posting](http://opensource.com/business/14/1/top-project-management-tools-2014).

Last year, I covered five of the best [open source project management tools](http://opensource.com/business/14/1/top-project-management-tools-2014), like ProjectLibre and OpenProject. The article struck a chord with readers and continues to prove valuable. So, this year I revisited the tools mentioned in last year's article, taking into account comments and suggestions from readers, and provided an update on where they are today. First, I share five new open source project management tools for 2015. All in all, this article will give you a good look at 11 of the top open source project management tools out there.

The criteria I used is based on the following:
- Is the software provided under an open source license?
- Does it have an active community?
- Does it have up-to-date documentation available?
- Is the source code available?
- Are there new or recent releases?

## Progress report on tools featured in 2014

Here's an update on the projects I covered last year.

[ProjectLibre](http://www.projectlibre.org/) has moved from version 1.5.8 to 1.5.9. It has not yet released version 2.0, nor is there a SaaS (software as a service) option available. In July 2014, ProjectLibre passed the 1 million mark for number of downloads.

[LibrePlan](http://www.libreplan.com/) current version is the one they released in April 2013. For a full update, check the [State of the Union 2015](http://www.jeroenbaten.nl/libreplan-state-union-2015/).

[OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) is active and continues to improve as evidenced by their [release notes](https://www.openproject.org/download/release-notes/). They are currently at version 4.0.4. The migration to Ruby on Rails 2.1 and 3.2 was successfully completed in March 2014 with their release of version 3.0.

[project-open](http://www.project-open.com/) released a 4.1 beta in June 2014. The expected 4.2 has not been released yet, but I spotted a version 5.0 on their roadmap for 2015.

[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) seems to continue with steady improvements.

The bonus tool I covered last year was [Agilefant](http://agilefant.com/). They have since implemented a paid-for version but continue to provide the basic tool as open source.
