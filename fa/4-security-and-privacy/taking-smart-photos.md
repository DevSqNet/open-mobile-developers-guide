Obscuracam is a photo and video app for Android that keeps certain information private.

Ever capture someone in a photo or video, then realize they may not want to be in it? Not comfortable posting a friend, family member or child’s face on the internet? Worried about the geolocation data in the picture giving away private hideaway? Tired of Facebook, Google and other sites “auto detecting” faces in your photos? Then this is for you, giving you the power to better protect the identity of those captures in your photos, before you post them online.

Take a picture or load a photo or video from the Gallery, and ObscuraCam will automatically detect faces that you can pixelate, redact (blackout) or protect with funny nose and glasses. You can also invert pixelate, so that only the person you select is visible, and no one in the background can be recognized.

This app will also remove all identifying data stored in photos including GPS location data and phone make & model. You can save the protected photo back to the Gallery, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter or any other “Share” enabled app.

We’re currently building a version of ObscuraCam for advanced users called [InformaCam](https://guardianproject.info/apps/informacam/). Users will have the option to secure images with PGP, inversely, to gather and broadcast additional details in metadata.

## How To Get The Latest Release

You can find the app in the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.witness.sscphase1&feature=search_result). For those without access to the Android Market, you can get the [ObscuraCam.APK file from our public builds folder](https://guardianproject.info/builds/Obscura/).  For this option, be sure to check back for updates, because the app will not auto-update itself.

## پس زمینه

We developed our more  secure and private camera application in partnership with [Witness.org](http://witness.org/), the leading human rights video advocacy and training organization. This collaboration grew out of an [open hackday at the 2010 Open Video Conference.](http://blog.witness.org/2010/10/ovc2010-opensubtitles/)

This is an open-source project and you can track our progress here: https://github.com/guardianproject/SecureSmartCam.
